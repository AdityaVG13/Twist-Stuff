Instructions for how to download the Twist Questbook: 

The DefaultQuests is the entire QuestBook from GTNH including a chapter on Twist that I made.  

To add it to your pack: 

First, click the blue `<> CODE` button and download ZIP

1. Go to configs
2. Navigate to the betterquesting folder 
3. DELETE the "DefaultQuests" folder.
4. Download the "DefaultQuests" Folder that exists on this repository
5. Copy it to the betterquesting folder, this will add the Twist Quest Page
6. Go in game and type the command `/bq_admin default load` (YOU DO NOT NEED OP FOR THIS), this will load the questbook with all the Twist Quests added. Because quests are saved world side, you will not lose any progress with your current quests, but please contact Aditya if you run into any troubles

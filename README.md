Instructions for how to download the Twist Questbook: 

The DefaultQuests is the entire QuestBook from GTNH including a chapter on Twist that I made.  

To add it to your pack: 

1. Go to configs
2. Navigate to the betterquesting folder 
3. DELETE the "DefaultQuests" folder.
4. Download the "DefaultQuests" Folder that exists on this repository
5. Copy it to the betterquesting folder, this will add the Twist Quest Page

THE NEXT STEPS ARE OPTIONAL (BUT MAY BREAK YOUR GAME, I MIGHT REMOVE THIS LATER, DON'T KNOW YET):

6. After downloading the quests, click on the resources folder
7. Download the "Images" Folder in my repository
8. Copy the "Images" Folder to inside your "resources" folder inside the betterquesting config folder

This will add a picture of me to the Twist Questbook page just as a meme. May or may not stay. 

After doing all this, go into game, and type "/bq_admin default load" to load the questbook with Twist in it.
